# Liri-bot

Hi, Welcome to Liri-Bot.

This is a program which the user can find concerts nearby, preview and information of favorite songs, or information on selected movies.

To get started, open up your terminal and type in "node", (space), followed by the name of the javascript file you are trying to run, which in this case is liri.js. Afterwards add another (space) and enter in the four following names that lead to functions which get the answers or results you are looking for:

1)Concert-this

2)Spotify-this-song

3)Movie-this

or 

4)Do-what-it-says

Once that is done, add another (space) and type in the variable for the function to process your result.

"Concert-this" accesses an api using axios from bandintown.com and searches for places where the particular artist is performing.

"Spotify-this-song" searches for a preview of and information of the song or album containing any word you chose to use as the variable when running this program.

"Movie-this searches for information on a particular movie name you enter into as the variable. It defaults to the movie Mr. Nobody if you dont enter or if the program cant find the name of the movie you are searching for.

"Do-what-it-says" runs any of the above three commands if you put in the command and variable (separated by a comma) in random.txt file.


Try it out and see what this program does for yourself!
